**Yeah, this is an AES-256 encrypted blob.**

And no, I won't share the decryption key. I don't want to threaten
anyone's role, nor take it away. At all.

If it turns out that we need this one, I'll eventually release
decrypted code.

Either way - I don't like how this feels, and I would be glad if this
isn't put into use.
